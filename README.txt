Projects from CS550 - Artificial Intelligence (Spring 2018)
Language used: Python

Assignment1/ - given the board class, create a shuffled 
               TileBoard (mimics an N-Puzzle) that users 
               can interact with on the command line to
               solve the puzzle

Assignment2/ - automate N-Puzzle solving from Assignment1
               using Breadth-First, Depth-First, and 
               Manhattan Search

Assignment3/ - implement a checkers AI using Alpha Beta 
               Search that users can play against

Assignment4/ - implement Sudoku solver using backtracking 
               search and AC3 (arc consistency)

Assignment5/ - k-fold cross validation different datasets
               using given Decision Tree and Neural Net
               Learners.
